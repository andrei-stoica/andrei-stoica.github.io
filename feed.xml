ever ring true here. It's clear! Rust being as hard as it is to learn
forced that team to create the best possible introduction to it. When you go to
the Rust-Lang website there are three ways to get
started under the learning tab.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2023 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://andreistoica.ca/posts/2021-07-23-Welcome/</guid><link>https://andreistoica.ca/posts/2021-07-23-Welcome/</link><title>Welcome</title><description>Hello World!Welcome to my new personal website!
