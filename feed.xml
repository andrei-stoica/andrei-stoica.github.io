my head, I was always confused by people who wrote things down, made lists and
crossed them off methodically. I kept hearing about how writing things down
with systems like the bullet journal or
obsidian helped people clear their minds. Things didn't
seem that complicated to me. Everything could fit in my head and the few things
that had hard due dates went into my calender. All these systems I heard of
just had too much going on. I had to memorize the system on top of what I
already had going on in my head.What I didn't realize at the time was that whatever system you use has to be
personal to you. The system you use needs to fill in you're personal week spots.
It needs to be a foundation that you can lean on when your floor starts to
shift. What I was hearing when learning about all of these systems was "what
people are doing" and "how it helped." The important part of learning a new
system is the "why am I doing this." The why is the key piece that informs how
useful it can be for you. As I gain more experience, I learn to focus less on
"whats" and "hows" and more on "whys."</description><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://andreistoica.ca/posts/2023-06-20-Rustlings-takeaway/</guid><link>https://andreistoica.ca/posts/2023-06-20-Rustlings-takeaway/</link><title>Rust has a lot to teach other languages</title><description>Recently, I decided to pick up Rust. While I'm not yet 100% comfortable with the
language, I have had one major takeaway from the experience. The new developer
experience for all other languages is trash!We all know the saying "Necessity is the mother of invention", but man does it
ever ring true here. It's clear! Rust being as hard as it is to learn
forced that team to create the best possible introduction to it. When you go to
the Rust-Lang website there are three ways to get
started under the learning tab.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2023 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://andreistoica.ca/posts/2021-07-23-Welcome/</guid><link>https://andreistoica.ca/posts/2021-07-23-Welcome/</link><title>Welcome</title><description>Hello World!Welcome to my new personal website! This will act as a outlet for the random
project that my ADHD brain starts. Starting with some of what I learned from
setting up this website itself.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
